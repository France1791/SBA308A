This project is a cat image generator app for cat lovers and anyone who just want to see cat images. 
I created an engaging user experience through the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, by creating a button where the user can click to see new random cat images.
I Use the fetch API to communicate with an external web API(cat API) and use the data provided by this API to populate the application content and features.
I also organized my code into at least three (3) different module files, and import functions and data across files as necessary.
